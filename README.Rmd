# Pipeline Bash Script

The script CRISPRScreenAnalysisWrapper_verXX.sh is to run the MAGeCK pipeline on
specified fastq files. If specified, it will also download fastq files from SRA
or the object store to a specified directory. The usage is describe below.

### Usage:
```
  Usage: ./CRISPRScreenAnalysisWrapper_verXX.sh 
            [ -o Object_store_paths ]
            [ -s SRA_IDs ]
            [ -b sample_labels ]
            [ -q fastq_filenames ] 
            [ -f fastq_directory ] 
            [ -l sgRNA_library_file ]
            [ -i sample_index_file ]
            [ -d design_matrix_file ]
            [ -n negative_control_sgRNA_file ]

  Note:  
        When multiple arguments are provided for a single option, they must
        all be enclosed in a set of single quotes. For example:
        -s 'SRR4880321 SRR4880322'
```

| -s              | SRA\_IDs                       | SRR IDs for any fastq files to transfer from SRA using fastq-dump                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| -b              | sample\_labels                 | Labels of samples. These will be the column headers for the counts table. Sample labels must be separated by commas, and they must be in the same order as the fastq\_filenames. A single sample label should be given for technical replicates (ie fastq files separated by commas in "-q fastq\_filenames"). |
| -q              | fastq\_filenames               | Filenames of fastq files. These should be listed in the same oder as the sample\_labels.

| -f              | fastq\_directory               | Optional directory where fastq files will be stored. This option should not be used unless the user wants to store the files locally. The default and preferred is to store the fastq files in scratch space.                                                                                                                                                   |

This file must be stored in the working directory.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| -n              | negative\_control\_sgRNA\_file | Name of the required negative control file. See the MAGeCK documentation for details. This file must be stored in the working directory.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

# Follow up Hits

## Individual Guide Assays

Measure the IC50 of cells expressing one guide and see if the IC50 shifts. Also we can measure how much the cells
grow when in different concentrations of Auxin. This will allow to to determine if hits are "real" or not.
